## Overview

This repository provides examples of data analytics workflows, focusing on the following:

- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often visualizing them.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from raw data to improve machine learning models or analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Using visual representations such as graphs and plots to communicate insights from data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing basic statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**: Demonstrates techniques for handling missing values, duplicates, and data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into data patterns and relationships using various visualization methods.
- **Feature Engineering**: Shows how to create new features for predictive modeling or analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to create meaningful visualizations for understanding data distributions, trends, and correlations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Includes examples of hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and other statistical methods to derive actionable insights from data.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **plotly**: For interactive visualizations.

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

If you're using Jupyter notebooks for exploration, you can also install JupyterLab:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

### 4. Data Cleaning and Wrangling

In the notebooks, you’ll find examples of cleaning data using **pandas**. These examples will help you:

- Handle missing values using `fillna()`, `dropna()`, and other techniques.
- Convert data types using `astype()`.
- Remove duplicate values using `drop_duplicates()`.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA notebooks demonstrate how to perform initial analysis on a dataset. You’ll use tools like:

- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing distributions, boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Correlation matrices** to examine relationships between variables.
- Summary statistics and aggregations to understand trends in the data.

### 6. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering notebooks provide methods for:

- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling and normalizing numerical features.
- Generating new features based on existing ones, like extracting year, month, or day from a datetime column.

### 7. Data Visualization

The notebooks use **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to create rich visualizations, including:

- **Bar charts**, **pie charts**, and **line graphs** to display data trends.
- **Heatmaps** and **pair plots** for understanding correlations and distributions.
- **Interactive visualizations** using **Plotly** for a deeper exploration of the data.
